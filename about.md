# About **PetcliniX**

## Introduction

**PetcliniX** is an open learning initiative designed to address a recurring gap in software education: the lack of realistic, 
comparable, full-scale examples. Most tutorials focus on isolated concepts—one pattern, one framework, or one small example. 
**PetcliniX** aims to change that by demonstrating **complete, real-world architectures** side-by-side.

Rather than a single code sample or “hello world” app, **PetcliniX** presents the same domain problem—a **veterinary clinic 
management system**—implemented across multiple architectures, languages, and frameworks. This allows developers to compare 
designs directly and learn architectural trade-offs in context.

## Why **PetcliniX** Exists

### 1. Tutorials Show Only Partial Views

Most educational materials highlight narrow technical slices: a single feature, a single layer, or a specific technology. They rarely show how all the pieces come together in a coherent, production-scale architecture.

**PetcliniX** fills that gap by showing **complete system implementations**, from domain modeling to infrastructure, across multiple stacks.

### 2. The “Todo App” Problem

The typical example app used in tutorials—a simple Todo List—is not enough to illustrate enterprise-level design. It lacks:

- Domain complexity  
- Real business rules  
- Interactions between subsystems  
- Integration and scalability challenges  

In contrast, **PetcliniX** uses a realistic and relatable domain with customers, pets, appointments, treatments, billing, and inventory. These complexities introduce authentic architecture decisions, similar to what real systems face.

### 3. Architecture Is Learned Through Comparison

**PetcliniX** allows developers to see how the same domain problem is solved with different approaches:

- How does Clean Architecture differ from Hexagonal?  
- How does an Event-Driven Microservice architecture handle the same logic as a Monolith?  
- What trade-offs come with CQRS or Event Sourcing?  

This comparative view helps learners build **architectural judgment**, not just coding skills.

## The **PetcliniX** Domain

To ensure fair comparison, **PetcliniX** uses a consistent domain model across all implementations. It has enough complexity 
to demonstrate architectural patterns without being overwhelming. The domain itself should be easy imagine and understand.
This creates enough complexity to demonstrate design patterns like domain-driven design (DDD), transactional consistency, and modular boundaries.

## Showcases and Analyses

The different implementations can be discovered and explored in the repository. Each implementation is executable and so
many different apsects can be compared directly.
The showcases show footprints of the system and the trade-offs made. There are several different cateogorties. 
- Footpring of the componentes (HD, Memory, CPU)
- Testability (Unit, Integration, E2E)
- Maintainability (Modularity, Coupling, Cohesion)
- Scalability (Horizontal, Vertical, Data)
- Deployment (CI/CD, Containerization, Orchestration)
- Complexity (Cyclomatic, Cognitive, Structural)
- Readability (Lines of Code, Documentation, Conventions)
- Performance (Latency, Throughput, Resource Usage)

## Educational Goals

**PetcliniX** is designed for developers, architects, and educators who want to learn by comparison. The key goals are:

### 1. Show the Full Picture
Each implementation includes complete domain logic, infrastructure, and user-facing workflows.

### 2. Explain Trade-Offs
Every architecture page highlights pros, cons, and suitable contexts.

### 3. Promote Realism
No contrived examples. All code reflects real-world challenges like data validation, concurrency, and modular growth.

### 4. Enable Self-Learning and Teaching
Instructors and teams can use **PetcliniX** to demonstrate architectural evolution and best practices.

## Learning by Comparison

By comparing architectures side-by-side, developers learn:

- Where complexity arises in each approach.  
- How layering and coupling differ.  
- How testing, maintainability, and deployment vary.  
- How scalability trade-offs appear in code.  

**PetcliniX** makes these insights tangible rather than theoretical.

---

## Long-Term Vision

**PetcliniX** aims to become an open, community-driven reference for real-world software architecture learning. The long-term goals include:

- Expanding architecture types and technology stacks.  
- Building visual comparison tools and diagrams.  
- Offering guided learning paths.  
- Hosting contributions and collaborative discussions.  

---

## Conclusion

**PetcliniX** bridges the gap between simple tutorials and enterprise-level reality. By showing multiple architectures applied 
to the same domain, it helps developers grasp the full picture of software design — not just syntax or patterns, but **how systems are actually built**.

If you’re tired of Todo apps and want to learn *architecture through comparison*, **PetcliniX** is your next step.
